#### Types
##### Core Types
- **number**: no matter either is `5`(int) or `6.1`(float), as long as is number
- **string**
- **boolean**

> Note: NOT `Number`, is `number`. Case Matter.

##### Type Assignment and Inference
1. You can specify a variable with semicolumn `:`, like:
```ts
function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
	//...
}
```
2. Inference, as Typescript will generate type for you
```ts
const count = 5 //knowing the variabel as `number`, specific is 5 as `number`
const isGood = true //as `boolean`

let count = 5 //`number`
let word = 'hello'//`string`
```
3. You can assign type on variables
```ts
let count: number = null
```
4. DO NOT do this, which is redundant
```ts
const count: number = 5
```
