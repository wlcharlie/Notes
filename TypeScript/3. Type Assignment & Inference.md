#### Type Assignment and Inference

##### Basic
1. You can specify a variable with semicolumn `:`, like:
```ts
function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
	//...
}
```
2. Inference, as Typescript will generate type for you
```ts
const count = 5 //knowing the variabel as `number`, specific is 5 as `number`
const isGood = true //as `boolean`

let count = 5 //`number`
let word = 'hello'//`string`
```
3. You can assign type on variables
```ts
let count: number = null
```
4. DO NOT do this, which is redundant
```ts
const count: number = 5
```

##### with `object`

>[!example]
>```ts
>const person = {
>	name: 'meow',
>	age: 4
>}
>
>console.log(person)

1. you can not access the key that is not exsit (just like javascript but with error when development)

2. object type inferrred by ts

3. can do this but not enough full support 
	* not enough info about the content inside the object (see the error `person.name`)
	* no inteill (see [[3. Type Assignment & Inference#^44ee70|next point (4.)]])

4. this is also same as [[#^433fe0|example]]
